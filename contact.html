        <h2>Getting in touch with Mr. Kercheval:</h2>
        <p>
            My door is always open to students seeking help, extra practice,
            or support with completing projects and making up tests. My planning
            period for the 2024-2025 school year is <b>4th period.</b>
            <br><br>
            I generally welcome walk-ins when I am not teaching, however 
            please make an appointment beforehand in order to see me before 
            or after school, during a period when I am teaching, or for
            situations that may require more than 15 minutes of one-on-one 
            support.
            <br><br>
